## ‚ú® Why This Project?

Electronic waste is the fastest-growing waste stream globally, posing significant environmental and health risks due to hazardous materials. Many individuals are unaware of their digital footprint or where to responsibly recycle old electronics. This application bridges that gap by offering:

* **Awareness**: Educating users about the impact of e-waste.
* **Actionability**: Providing tools to calculate, track, and locate recycling points.
* **Community**: Fostering a platform for reporting and collective action.

Our goal is to empower users to become active participants in the circular economy for electronics, making informed decisions that contribute to a healthier planet.
